# Slack Best Practices
_Use Slack responsible._

## Channels
* Limit creating new channels when ever possible.
* Create DM groups instead of a single purpose channel.

* Limit `@channel` when ever possible. You're basically sending text messages to everyone in that channel.
* Don't double post in channels. 

## Your profile
* Upload an avatar. It helps others identify you if you haven't met in person.
* Keep your time zone up to date.
* Update your do not disturb times so other know when to contact you.

## Media
* Auto collapse media on your slack phone app.
