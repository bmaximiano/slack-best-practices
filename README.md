# Slack Best Practices
_Use Slack responsible._

## Channels
* Limit creating new channels whenever possible.
* Create DM groups instead of a single purpose channel.
* If others could benefit from your message, put it in a channel.
* Limit `@channel` whenever possible. You're basically sending text messages to everyone in that channel.
* Don't double post in channels. 

## Your profile
* Upload an avatar. It helps others identify you if you haven't met in person.
* Keep your time zone up to date.
* Update your Do Not Disturb times so others know when to contact you.

## Media
* Auto collapse media on your slack phone app.

## Tips and tricks
* `⌘ K` or `⌘ T` Jump to a DM or a Channel.
